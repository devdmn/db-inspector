# DB Inspector

**DB Inspector** is a lightweight, web-based SQL client that connects to a database using a connection URL. It allows you to run raw SQL queries and view the results in a structured table format. It also includes an AI assistant that can interpret natural language questions, generate corresponding SQL queries, and execute them on your behalfâ€”after asking for your confirmation. The assistant then displays the results and provides an explanation in plain English based on the output.

## Features

- Connect to a database using a connection string
- Write and execute custom SQL queries
- View results in a tabular format
- Chat with an AI assistant to generate SQL from natural language
- Review and approve AI-generated queries before execution

## Tech Stack
